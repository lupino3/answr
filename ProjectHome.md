answr is a simple web application that answers questions from the user.

You can see the most recent code running at http://www.answr.it

As you can see, the algorithm is quite simple: it takes a question from the user, discards it and outputs a random answer.

It is intended as a simple playground for experiments with Google App Engine and other APIs like Twitter or Facebook integration.

You can ask questions via Twitter (mentioning @answrit) and XMPP (answr-it@appspot.com).

Answr is released under the Affero GNU GPL version 3 or later.
